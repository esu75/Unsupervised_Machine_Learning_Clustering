# Unsupervised_Machine_Learning_Clustering

In this project,  use your Python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.

## Instructions
1.	Load the crypto_market_data.csv into a DataFrame.
2.	Get the summary statistics and plot the data to see what the data looks like before proceeding.
### Prepare the Data

•	Use the StandardScaler() module from scikit-learn to normalize the data from the CSV file.

•	Create a DataFrame with the scaled data and set the "coin_id" index from the original DataFrame as the index for the new DataFrame.

	    i. The first five rows of the scaled DataFrame should appear as follows:
